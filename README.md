Intelligent Automation Process for Insurance Claiming
Automobile insurance is effectively a contract between yourself and an insurance company in which you agree to pay premiums in exchange for protection against financial losses stemming from an accident or other damage to the vehicle. The insurance company agrees to pay your losses as outlined in your policy. Policies are priced individually to let you customize coverage amounts to suit your exact needs and budget. An auto insurance policy will cover you and other family members on the policy, whether driving your car or someone elseâ€™s car (with their permission). Your policy also provides coverage to someone who is not on your policy and is driving your car with your consent.  
Our project is targeted for automobile insurance sector, which refers to tell us about the prediction of claiming the insurance by selecting some terms (like damages, condition, cost, performance etc..) . Now a days data is playing a vital role in the automobile insurance industry, in the development of insurance models we have to follow the certain conditions of every vehicle.   By the features and the labelling it will give out the accurate output. Our model predicts by referring more algorithms of each attribute or term. By predicting the damage, it can tell us about the amount premium which will pay to the person. This prediction will be considering the task of checking loss using machine learning techniques and python.
